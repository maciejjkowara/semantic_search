            "[SUMMARY]\n",
            "While an experienced team runs Putnam Mortgage Securities Fund, its complex and aggressive approach has not paid off for investors. \n",
            "Michael Salm, an expert in mortgage credit and interest-rate derivates, has been managing this fund since 2007. After a brief hiatus as the chief investment officer of Putnam from 2021 through 2023, Salm reassumed his lead manager role here from Brett Kozlowski who was let go from the firm in September 2024 following Franklin\u2019s acquisition of Putnam. The three comanagers who join Salm also bring a wealth of experience\u2014Jatin Misra has worked alongside Salm since 2017 and manages the portfolio day-to-day, while Paul Varunok and Neil Dhruv, both Franklin veterans with at least two decades of experience each, round out the effort. A sizable team of 14 securitized analysts, 10 of which have a decade or more of experience, support the managers.\n",
            "This seasoned crew has a high appetite for risk, however. The strategy's broad mandate and elaborate approach to individual trade construction result in an overly complex portfolio that has not served investors well. The team takes substantial active bets with mortgage credit and prepayment risks compared with its more conservative benchmark, the Bloomberg US Mortgage Backed Securities Index. In addition to out-of-benchmark nonagency residential mortgage-backed securities, the strategy holds meaningful allocations to agency-backed TBAs (a type of forward purchasing contract), collateralized mortgage obligations, and non-agency commercial MBS. Allocations to these sectors have remained substantial since the strategy\u2019s expansion of mandate in 2018 to include non-agency debt. \n",
            "Yet, the strategy's exposure to these risks can change quickly and significantly, making it difficult to form expectations on its performance pattern. Investors have experienced a bumpy ride since 2019 with the fund\u2019s calendar year returns swinging between the category\u2019s top and bottom quartile. Over the trailing five years ending January 2025, its Y share class lost 1.3% annualized as against its peer median which gained 0.1%, Much of the strategy\u2019s pain in recent years can be attributed to sizable stakes in high-yield CMBS tranches, which have suffered significantly because of industry headwinds.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PEOPLE]\n",
            "The management team\u2019s experience in mortgage credit notwithstanding, their appetite for higher risk combined with team changes that followed Franklin\u2019s early 2024 acquisition support an Average People rating.\n",
            "Michael Salm, a longtime manager on this strategy, reassumed his lead management responsibilities from Brett Kozlowski when the latter was let go in September 2024. Salm had managed this strategy since 2007 but stepped away for a brief period between 2021 and 2023 to serve as Putnam\u2019s chief investment officer. Salm is joined by Paul Varunok, Neil Dhruv, and Jatin Misra. Misra has worked alongside Salm on this fund since 2017 and manages the day-to-day activities, and Varunok and Dhruv come from Franklin Templeton, each having more than two decades of experience. Varunok is the head of securitized research and reports to Salm, while Dhruv is a senior trader for MBS. \n",
            "A group of 14 securitized analysts supports the managers. This cohort is strong with 10 out of the 14 having more than a decade\u2019s experience, but seven of the analysts joined as part of the acquisition, and the dust still needs to settle on this combined team. This sizable team sits globally, which is also a change compared with the previous Putnam team that was based in Boston.  \n",
            "Only one out of the four managers has at least USD 10,000 invested in this strategy and can better align their interests with investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PROCESS]\n",
            "A complex process with a bias toward riskier mortgage credit has led to more volatility without commensurate benefits, warranting a Below Average Process rating.\n",
            "The team develops tactical, macro-driven strategies based on its expectations for changes in loan prepayment and default rates and the volatility of interest rates and often uses derivates to implement those strategies. \n",
            "The managers focus on the four risks that they believe drive bond returns: term structure (or interest-rate risk), the prepayment risk of securitized bonds, credit risk, and liquidity risk. They examine each bond separately and attempt to hedge any unwanted risks, also using derivatives. For example, the managers favor interest-only, or IO, bonds, which are created by separating the interest and principal payments of a mortgage-backed security. IOs have negative durations (their prices move in tandem with interest rates rather than inversely) and are very sensitive to changes in mortgage prepayment rates. The team tries to neutralize IOs' negative duration by pairing them with agency MBS TBAs (a type of forward purchasing contract), but the process can lead to heightened market risk exposure, as in 2022, when the fund's MBS TBA stake soared to 175% of net assets at year-end from 39% in January 2022.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PORTFOLIO]\n",
            "Unlike many of its intermediate core-plus bond Morningstar Category peers, the fund\u2019s considerable securitized risk profile is further elevated by stakes in agency-backed IO (18% of assets as of December 2024) and inverse IO (11%) bonds that make up much of its 31% agency collateralized mortgage obligation bucket. The managers have almost doubled the allocation to inverse IOs over the past two years from 6% of assets back in December 2022 alluding to a favorable market environment for those securities and relatively cheap valuations. \n",
            "Sizable and rapid changes in portfolio positioning aren't unusual here. During lead manager Brett Kozlowski\u2019s tenure, the fund's combined out-of-benchmark stake in CMBS and nonagency residential MBS peaked at 69% of assets in March 2022 and then troughed at 53% nine months later in December. The termination of a profitable swap on the expected returns of an index of CMBS bonds explained most of that decline. The strategy\u2019s higher emphasis on off-benchmark lower-rated CMBS than peers has been particularly painful in the past.\n",
            "The strategy's credit risk profile can also change when the managers see opportunities leading it to be much riskier than peers. As of December 2024, 30% of portfolio assets were rated B or below, including 15% nonrated versus 8% for the category median. The fund\u2019s below-investment-grade sleeve comprised of CMBS and nonagency RMBS.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PERFORMANCE]\n",
            "The fund\u2019s long-term performance is underwhelming; its Y share class gained 0.8% annualized over the past decade ending January 2025, which was one of the worst in the intermediate core-plus category. Over the same period, the fund\u2019s volatility was among the highest in the category, leading to a poor risk-adjusted return profile. The heightened volatility is best showcased with its top- and bottom-quartile performance year over year since 2019. The fund\u2019s 0.4% and 4.0% losses in 2020 and 2021, respectively, were the worst within the category, while its 10.6% loss in 2022 was far less pronounced than 90.0% of its peers. The fund\u2019s exposure to CMBS and credit risk transfers was to blame for rock-bottom results in 2020 and 2021, but the team\u2019s tactical positioning in agency MBS and CMBS in 2022 helped cushion the blow in the following year. Still, the strategy struggled again in 2023 owing to its exposure to further beaten-down CMBS; its 3.9% gain was one of the worst in the category and lagged its Bloomberg US Mortgage Backed Securities Index by 116 basis points. \n",
            "The primary drivers of performance in recent years have been agency MBS credit spreads, CMBS, and changes in loan prepayment speeds. The team\u2019s heavier stakes in mortgage credit can cause it to lag when credit markets sell off such as in the pandemic-driven selloff of early 2020 when the fund\u2019s 14% loss lagged most peers, while its benchmark gained 1%.\n",

            "Fidelity Mortgage Securities\u2019 combination of experienced structured product investors and strong quantitative capabilities inspires confidence.\n",
            "A pair of seasoned Fidelity veterans work closely together here. Co-managers Franco Castagliuolo and Sean Corcoran run the firm\u2019s mortgage desk, with Castagliuolo taking the lead on retail products, including this one. He began his mortgage career in 2002 trading specified pools, TBAs (a common type of mortgage forward), and collateralized mortgage obligations before moving into portfolio management at the end of 2009. Corcoran got started as a structured product analyst in 2001 and eventually joined Castagliuolo as comanager in 2017.\n",
            "The managers of this high-quality government offering focus their efforts on agency mortgage-backed securities but have the flexibility to venture outside of its Bloomberg MBS Index, including across various nonagency structures. Such flexibility has long placed it on the cusp of the intermediate core bond and intermediate government Morningstar Categories. The June 2024 decision to group the strategy in the intermediate government category was predicated on the belief that the portfolio\u2019s long-term composition is better reflected by government-focused peers. Its June 2024 portfolio\u2019s 11% nongovernment stake consisted of nonagency commercial MBS and residential MBS as well as asset-backed securities and was up from its 7% trailing five-year average stake.\n",
            "True to Fidelity\u2019s style, the team doesn\u2019t typically make large interest-rate bets and instead plays to its strengths of bottom-up security selection. The managers make use of tools like Treasury futures and interest-rate swaps to maintain a tight duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity) band of 0.3 year around their MBS-focused index.\n",
            "Quantitative modeling aids fundamental research here. In addition to a proprietary mortgage prepayment model, the firm\u2019s commitment to expanding its quantitative capabilities has led to more nuanced risk budgeting across its fixed-income complex, including mortgage strategies like this one. Such resources are critical in gaining information advantages over lesser-resourced firms relying solely on third-party models.\n",
            "The strategy\u2019s unique opportunity set complicates peer performance comparisons. Its 100% agency-backed Bloomberg MBS Index is a decent comparison point, though the fund\u2019s relative performance can at times be dominated by the portfolio\u2019s nonagency allocations. The Z share class\u2019 2.29% annualized return over Castagliuolo\u2019s tenure from January 2010 through August 2024 bested its bogy by 27 basis points.\n",

            "Fidelity\u2019s structured products team offers a blend of seasoned veterans and impressive up-and-coming talent, supporting an Above Average People rating.\n",
            "An experienced duo, comanagers Franco Castagliuolo and Sean Corcoran run the firm\u2019s mortgage desk, which managed over $57 billion in assets as of June 2024. Both managers have spent the entirety of their careers at Fidelity but have taken different paths in doing so. Castagliuolo got started in the firm\u2019s muni department before moving over to this team in 2002, at which point he traded specified pools, TBAs, and CMOs. Castagliuolo then moved into portfolio management in 2009, working for nearly a decade alongside longtime manager Bill Irving before Irving\u2019s 2017 retirement. Corcoran began his career as a structured product analyst in 2001 and eventually joined Castagliuolo as comanager in 2017.\n",
            "The veteran pair of managers share responsibilities on all the desk\u2019s accounts, with Castagliuolo taking the lead on retail offerings like this one. They draw on a veteran supporting cast of seven dedicated structured products analysts and four traders as well as a shared macro team, which features three analysts and three traders.\n",
            "Managers\u2019 personal investments can be a good sign of alignment with fundholders\u2019 interests. Castagliuolo invests between $100,000 and $500,000 in this strategy, while Corcoran invests over $1 million.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PROCESS]\n",
            "This sensible government approach stands out in part thanks to the firm\u2019s continued investment in quantitative resources, underpinning its Above Average Process rating.\n",
            "This strategy is indexed to the Bloomberg MBS Index, though the managers make use of their flexibility to venture outside of this 100% agency-backed index. True to Fidelity\u2019s style, the team doesn\u2019t typically make large interest-rate bets and instead plays to its strengths of bottom-up selection. The managers scrutinize underlying mortgage pools to identify loans they think will exhibit slower and more stable prepayment activity than suggested by market prices. They also keep a close eye on changes in government policies that affect mortgage refinancing behavior.\n",
            "Quantitative modeling aids fundamental, bottom-up credit research here. Outside of a proprietary mortgage prepayment model developed over the past two-plus decades, the firm\u2019s commitment to expanding its quantitative capabilities has also led to more nuanced risk budgeting across the fixed-income complex, including mortgage strategies like this one. Such resources are necessary to stay ahead in a crowded category full of competitors with their own home-grown models.\n",
            "The team makes modest use of leverage by using TBAs, a common type of mortgage forward, to gain exposure to the mortgage market and invests the cash backing these to gain additional mortgage exposure depending on relative value opportunities. The comanagers often use Treasury futures in tandem with interest-rate swaps to maintain a tight grip on the portfolio\u2019s duration (a common measure of interest-rate risk), which they typically manage within 0.3 year of the strategy\u2019s index.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PORTFOLIO]\n",
            "Many of this portfolio\u2019s themes have persisted over time. For example, the managers tend to favor 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with prepayment-resistant characteristics. They also tend to find better relative value in MBS passthrough securities than they do in CMOs, although the portfolio\u2019s 7% average CMO allocation over the trailing year through June 2024 was up from recent lows.\n",
            "The strategy\u2019s investment in nonagency fare causes it to straddle the intermediate core bond and intermediate government categories. Its allocation to such investments averaged 7% over the trailing three years through June 2024, at various points breaching the intermediate government category\u2019s 10% limit. It was moved to its current intermediate government category in June 2024, based on the opinion that the portfolio\u2019s long-term composition is more accurately depicted by that of government-focused peers.\n",
            "Within the portfolio\u2019s nonagency bucket, the managers allocate across RMBS, CMBS, and various types of asset-backed securities. They are especially sensitive to valuations in these subsectors. For example, in 2020 they trimmed the nongovernment stake down to 1% by the end of the year from 12% at the beginning of the year owing to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly the CMBS sector. As valuations have cheapened recently, they increased the strategy\u2019s nonagency stake to 11% of assets as of June 2024, up from 8% a year prior, with notable additions to CMBS and auto ABS positions.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PERFORMANCE]\n",
            "This strategy\u2019s unique opportunity set means relative performance should be taken with a grain of salt. Its pure agency-backed Bloomberg US Mortgage-Backed Securities Index is a decent starting point, though recent additions to the portfolio\u2019s nonagency sleeve make it less accurate proxy for expected performance. Over lead manager Franco Castagliuolo\u2019s tenure from January 2010 through August 2024, the Z share class\u2019 2.29% annualized gain outpaced its benchmark by 27 basis points. Nonagency debt together with modest leverage has helped drive the strategy\u2019s performance versus its benchmark over much of that period, though it has also had success in recent years with selection decisions in its agency stake.\n",
            "The strategy\u2019s long-term results stack up favorably versus intermediate government category peers despite it being grouped in the intermediate core bond category prior to June 2024. It outperformed its distinct intermediate government peer median in seven of the past 10 calendar years, but it\u2019s difficult to gauge how much of that was driven by elevated allocations to nongovernment holdings offering higher yields.\n",
            "Still, this strategy remains a viable long-term option so long as investors understand the wider risk budget associated with this mandate relative to strategies dealing in 100% government-backed debt.\n",

            "[SUMMARY]\n",
            "Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF, or JMBS, blends its core agency mortgage focus with significant flexibility for nonagency holdings, positioning it at the intersection of traditional mortgage-backed securities funds and broader intermediate-government bond strategies.\n",
            "Among the select few actively managed mortgage exchange-traded funds in a landscape dominated by passive options, JMBS maintains latitude to allocate up to 20% toward non-US-government securities\u2014exceeding the 10% threshold for the intermediate-government Morningstar Category. For now, though, the fund remains in this peer group, which is not obviously faulty, given that the fund has, since inception, shown higher correlation with its benchmark, the Bloomberg US Mortgage Backed Securities Index, than with the intermediate-core bond category\u2019s Bloomberg US Aggregate (though only marginally higher). \n",
            "While the fund can diversify across asset-backed securities and even corporate debt, agency MBS constitutes its primary holdings. The investment approach centers on prepayment analysis, leveraging loan-level data, quantitative tools, and fundamental research to identify market dislocations while maintaining interest-rate sensitivity comparable with the benchmark\u2019s. However, the management team's readiness to employ leverage to amplify the portfolio's market exposure and returns differs from most traditional mortgage funds that don\u2019t pull this lever.\n",
            "Portfolio managers Nick Childs and John Kerschner contribute deep expertise in securitized markets, particularly in MBS investing. Childs joined in 2017 with substantial MBS asset-management experience before becoming a portfolio manager in 2018. Kerschner, bringing more than three decades of industry knowledge, has led the firm's US securitized division since 2010, methodically expanding his Denver team from just himself to a comprehensive unit with four analysts, two quantitative specialists, and a dedicated trader.\n",
            "Now, with more than six years of history since its September 2018 launch, the strategy has demonstrated compelling results against the intermediate-government category, although aided by the ETF\u2019s use of leverage. Through March 31, 2025, its five-year annualized return of 0.53% surpassed more than 90% of its distinct peers. This outperformance still arrives with elevated volatility, however, but not high enough to be a deal breaker for potential investors. The fund also looks competitive against the intermediate-core bond category, where it might, at some point, migrate. Over the same five-year period through March 2025, its return meaningfully outpaced that category\u2019s distinct peer median 0.11% gain.\n",

            "John Kerschner and Nick Childs have led this offering since its 2018 inception. Kerschner, a 30-year industry veteran, joined Janus Henderson in 2010 to build out the firm\u2019s securitized capabilities and currently heads its US securitized products team. He has assembled the group gradually over the past decade, shaping a cohesive and disciplined unit. Childs joined Janus Henderson in 2017 from Proprietary Capital, where he ran MBS-focused strategies and brings additional experience from his time covering securitized products at Barclays Capital.\n",
            "The team\u2019s primary resources remain Denver-based, with limited input from Janus Henderson\u2019s London securitized staff\u2014appropriate given this strategy\u2019s exclusive focus on US debt. The core group includes Kerschner and Childs as portfolio managers, four securitized analysts, two quantitative analysts, and a dedicated trader.\n",
            "Both managers have meaningful personal investments in the strategy: Kerschner between USD 100,000 and USD 500,000, and Childs between USD 500,000 and USD 1 million. These stakes come in addition to their substantial investments in other Janus Henderson funds they manage\u2014a positive sign of alignment with shareholders.\n",

            "\n",
            "In a market segment dominated by passive ETFs, this strategy\u2019s active approach offers some notable advantages, though its use of leverage increases risk\u2014supporting a Process rating of Average.\n",
            "The fund aims to outpace its benchmark, the Bloomberg US Mortgage Backed Securities Index, by 50 basis points annually after fees, drawing on three primary levers: the team\u2019s expertise in mortgage prepayment modeling, the use of leverage, and out-of-index exposures. The managers augment third-party analytics with their own assumptions, dissecting mortgage pools to identify loans with desirable characteristics. Monthly prepayment forecasts further inform portfolio positioning to reflect current market dynamics and uncover relative value.\n",
            "Prepayment modeling, however, cannot be applied to to-be-announced, or TBA, forward MBS, whose underlying pool composition is unknown at purchase. As such, this segment of the strategy functions effectively as leveraged beta exposure rather than a source of idiosyncratic alpha; 20% leverage seems to be the norm for the ETF. Beyond the index, the fund expands its opportunity set by selectively investing\u2014up to a 20% cap\u2014in nonagency mortgages, asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and, on occasion, corporate bonds.\n",
            "A duration-neutral stance keeps the fund\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity closely aligned with its benchmark\u2014a prudent choice, given the historical difficulty active managers have faced in consistently adding value through interest-rate positioning.\n",

            "Only marginal changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The portfolio saw only marginal changes over the past year, with managers maintaining a consistent stance on risk and positioning.\n",
            "Duration has held steady in the 4.0- to 4.5-year range throughout 2024 and into early 2025\u2014roughly half a year longer than the intermediate-government category median\u2014reflecting a moderate, though not deliberate, tilt toward interest-rate risk relative to the fund\u2019s peers.\n",
            "The fund's TBAs rose to 23% of assets as of March 2025, up from 18% a year earlier. This increase offset a modest reduction in specified agency MBS pools, which declined from 60% to 55% over the same period. The allocation shift suggests no material change in the team\u2019s view on agency MBS valuations, but it does reflect an ongoing willingness to adjust the mix of pass-through exposure based on market dynamics and liquidity.\n",
            "Nonagency positions remained stable. Asset-backed securities accounted for about 10% of assets\u2014similar to year-ago levels\u2014and included exposures to auto loans and home-equity loans. Notably absent were credit card-backed securities, signaling a somewhat cautious view toward consumer credit. CMBS and nonagency residential mortgage-backed securities made up smaller slices of the portfolio.\n",
            "While modest in absolute terms, the portfolio\u2019s 1.4% exposure to below-investment-grade bonds (little changed from the previous year) continues to stand out in a category where the median fund has no high-yield exposure at all.\n",

From Oct. 1, 2018, through March 31, 2025, it posted a 1.89% annualized return, comfortably ahead of the index\u2019s 1.16%. That 73-basis-point excess return, net of fees, reflects the managers\u2019 effective use of prepayment modeling, active positioning, measured risk-taking, and leverage.\n",
            "Strong absolute performance has translated into strong relative standing. Over the same period, the fund\u2019s return ranked in the top decile of its distinct peers in the intermediate-government category. Low costs contributed: The fund charges just 0.22%, providing a clear edge over many active rivals.\n",
            "Still, investors should be prepared for a bumpier ride than is typical for this group. The strategy\u2019s broader securitized sleeve and use of leverage contribute to elevated volatility: Since its inception, its standard deviation has averaged around 7% versus 6% for the category median. That difference may appear modest in isolation but becomes stark in moments of market stress. In March 2020, at the onset of the pandemic-driven crisis, the ETF dropped 1.27%\u2014the second-worst result in the category\u2014while the median peer gained 1.37%.\n",

            "Jeff Dutra and Justin McWhorter spearhead the strategy, and their deep understanding of mortgage markets separates this team from its intermediate government bond Morningstar Category peers. Their areas of experience include collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage derivatives, and nonagency mortgages. The two managers plus analyst, John Zhang make up Voya's agency mortgage-backed securities team. This trio draws support from an eight-person mortgage derivatives team, a risk and quantitative research team, and Voya's broader securitized team, which includes commercial mortgage-backed securities and nonagency teams for added insights.\n",
            "While top-down drivers are a key input into this investment process, bottom-up analysis on individual cash flows primarily drives performance here. Quantitative inputs are foundational because of the nature of the asset class, and the team uses several third-party prepayment models, keeping an eye out for their inherent flaws. The managers take a long-term approach, and the team places an emphasis on understanding borrower attributes, security structures, and how they change over time, while also diving into individual cash flows. Given the manager's depth of experience, they typically find long-term value in securities that are outside of its benchmark, the Bloomberg GNMA Index, such as agency CMOs, agency CMBS, and other agency mortgage products. \n",
            "The manager's ability to consistently extract value from security selection in agency CMOs stands out relative to peers. The managers also effectively use leverage through TBA forward contracts on pass-through securities, gaining mortgage exposure and investing the cash underlying TBAs in floating-rate CMOs. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the portfolio's market exposure stood at 125% of net assets.\n",

The duo manages this strategy in tandem and has worked together for more than two decades at Voya. Before their current roles, Dutra ran the operations and accounting groups responsible for the firm's financial and mortgage derivatives, and McWhorter focused on the analysis of agency MBS and CMOs. The manager's familiarity with the nuances of CMOs and mortgage derivatives markets separates this team from most peers. The two managers and securitized analyst John Zhang, who joined the firm in 2022, form Voya\u2019s agency MBS team. \n",
            "They don\u2019t manage this strategy in isolation, though. While the primary decision-making lies with Dutra and McWhorter, they collaborate with the firm\u2019s eight-person mortgage derivative team daily. Peter Guan, a named manager on this strategy from 2009 to 2019, heads that group and is an added resource here. They also draw on the firm\u2019s larger fixed-income group, including the CMBS and nonagency teams, and a macro and quantitative research team for added insights on prepayment speeds, interest rates, mortgage positioning, and other sector views. Manager investment could be higher. Both Dutra and McWhorter invest less than USD 50,000 directly in the fund.

The team leverages several third-party models with different prepayment calculations to analyze each security. They always keep an eye out for inherent flaws in prepayment models and subsequently adjust positioning based on their assessment of these models. The team generates a range of possible cash flow scenarios and makes final buy-and-sell decisions based on the outputs of each model and their market's own insights. \n",

The team also utilizes input from Voya's broader fixed-income team to guide macro positioning; however, these managers are given ample flexibility to deviate from these views based on flaws they predict to be in prepayment models as well as any hedging they deem necessary. GNMA pass-throughs are the portfolio's centerpiece; however, security selection in out-of-benchmark securities typically drives outperformance relative to the Bloomberg GNMA Index.

            "Out-of-benchmark allocations include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, as well as agency-backed CMOs and CMBS, when relative valuations make sense. The managers also find value using leverage through mortgage pass-through TBAs, a type of forward contract, and they invest the cash underlying TBAs in floating-rate CMOs to earn a spread. Managers don't make large interest-rate bets and invest in Treasury futures to manage duration.\n",
            "The manager\u2019s expertise in agency CMOs separates this strategy from peers, and the portfolio features a significant allocation to these securities. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the fund held about 45% of assets in CMOs. The portfolio\u2019s total exposure to agency mortgages increased to 125% of net assets, up from 117% on Dec. 31, 2023. \n",
            "The fund does modestly lean into more complex structures such as interest-only strips and Z-Accrual tranches, which add diversification and higher yields but can also increase volatility. Almost 20% of the fund's net assets are in higher yielding Z-Accrual tranches of CMOs, which tend to be of longer duration, less liquid, and more volatile, as it is the tranche that is paid out last. The team is calculated to achieve this more complex exposure and utilizes these tools when cash flows are deemed safe.\n",
            "The managers don't make large interest-rate bets and invest in Treasury futures to manage duration. As of Dec. 31, 2024, its 5.8-year duration sat longer than the benchmark\u2019s 5.5-year duration.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PERFORMANCE]\n",
            "Consistently strong execution has delivered solid long-term results.\n",
            "During Jeff Dutra and Justin McWhorter\u2019s tenure from June 2009 through January 2025, the institutional shares\u2019 2.3% annualized return beat over 85% of its distinct peers in the intermediate government bond category. Adjusted for volatility, performance looks even more attractive. The fund\u2019s Sharpe ratio landed in the upper decile of category peers.\n",
            "While the strategy has rewarded patient investors over the years, the team has had some missteps along the way. For instance, it ranked in the bottom quartile of category peers in 2020, owing to exposures in less-liquid CMOs and its short-duration posture when rates decreased significantly in the first half of the year.\n",
            "Relative results in recent years are attractive, with the fund placing in the category's top quintile each of the last four years. In 2022, the fund outperformed 80% of its peers because of its shorter duration profile during the first half of the year. The fund also benefited from the team\u2019s tactic of allocating to TBAs and investing the cash in floating-rate CMOs, which held up during the rising rate environment.\n",
            "The managers attempt to drive results through out-of-benchmark security selection over the long haul, but this approach can lead to occasional underperformance when markets get bumpy.\n",

            "[SUMMARY]\n",
            "American Funds Mortgage excels at a conservative approach to investing in mortgage-backed securities.\n",
            "\n",
            "That excellence stems from a veteran team behind this multimanager offering. Fergus MacDonald has run a sleeve of this fund since its 2010 inception and took over as head of the team in charge of monitoring aggregate fund-level exposures in early 2021. MacDonald assumed that leadership role from David Betanzos, who remains on the team and has run a portfolio sleeve here since 2013. Although Oliver Edmonds' late-2019 start makes him the most recent addition to this strategy's roster, he previously served as a mortgage-backed securities analyst for the fund and has been at Capital Group for over two decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "The three managers benefit from strong investment resources. They work closely with the fund's two veteran agency MBS analysts, as well as six securitized analysts and Capital Group's interest-rates group led by Ritchie Tuazon, who comanages alongside MacDonald and Betanzos on sibling American Funds US Government Securities.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Keeping tabs on interest rates along with the yield premiums over Treasuries informs the team's agency MBS-centered approach. Over the trailing year ended in March 2025, for example, the managers cut the fund's MBS weighting from 90% to 76% of assets as option-adjusted spreads contracted. Meanwhile, over the same period, they increased the portfolio's combined allocation to Treasuries and cash 14 percentage points to 21.3%\n",
            "\n",
            "The team's caution tends to pay off in turbulent periods. Between Feb. 20 and April 8, 2025, worries about the economic impact of tariffs caused the S&P 500 to shed 18.75%. This fund, on the other hand, gained 2.12% over that stretch, second best out of the roughly 30 Morningstar Category rivals focused on agency MBS. In fact, this fund has placed in the top third or better of that customized peer group in every equity market drop of at least 10% since the fund's late-2010 inception.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The fund isn't foolproof. Positioning the portfolio to benefit from an anticipated steepening of the yield curve hurt in 2023 and 2024, for example. \n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, though, the strategy has been a strong performer. The R6 shares' 1.46% annualized return over the 10 years ended April 23, 2025, beat the Bloomberg US Mortgage-Backed Securities Index by 50 basis points while placing first among the 25 agency-MBS-focused peers within the intermediate government category with a track record that long.\n",
            "\n",
            "This fund remains a great option for agency MBS exposure.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PEOPLE]\n",
            "Stable and experienced.\n",
            "\n",
            "American Funds' multimanager system helps to handle this fund's roughly $11 billion asset base, now the intermediate government category's biggest active offering focused on agency mortgage-backed securities. The fund merits a High People rating because of the system\u2019s strengths as well as the investment team's experience, ability, and fund ownership.\n",
            "\n",
            "American Funds' parent Capital Group splits this fund's assets between its three named managers and the analyst-led research portfolio. Fergus MacDonald, who has run a portfolio sleeve since the fund's late-2010 inception, took over as head of the team in charge of monitoring aggregate fund-level exposures in early 2021. He assumed this leadership role from David Betanzos, who remains on the team and has run a portfolio sleeve here since 2013. Oliver Edmonds joined as a manager in 2019 after serving as an MBS analyst for the fund.\n",
            "\n",
            "The three managers, whose industry experience ranges from 21 to 32 years, can invest their sleeves of the overall portfolio in line with their backgrounds and convictions, provided they adhere to the fund's mortgage mandate and its risk guardrails. The managers draw on eight securitized analysts, including two veteran agency MBS analysts who oversee the research portfolio. Four securitized traders and four interest-rate specialists round out the team.\n",
            "\n",
            "MacDonald has more than $1 million in the fund, while Betanzos and Edmonds invest at least $500,000 and $100,000, respectively, which illustrates their alignment alongside fundholders.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PROCESS]\n",
            "Dialing mortgage exposure and interest-rate risk up and down.\n",
            "\n",
            "This fund's valuation-sensitive and conservative approach earns an Above Average Process rating.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fund's three named managers and analyst-led research portfolio focus primarily on agency mortgage-backed securities, both specified pools and mortgage TBAs, a very liquid type of forward purchasing contract. That liquidity is important because the team is more willing than many of its mortgage-focused intermediate government category peers to significantly alter MBS exposure, increasing it to around 90% of assets as valuation spreads widen and dropping it to about 50% when they narrow. The team eschews leverage and esoteric mortgage derivatives, which can heighten volatility, while limiting exposure to higher-quality nongovernment securitized debt to about 5%, on average. When they think MBS valuations are rich, the managers buy FNMA, FHLMC, and Federal Home Loan Bank debentures and discount notes to keep housing-related exposure above 80%, in line with a broad interpretation of the fund's mortgage moniker. While the risk profile of such agency debt is minimal, it lacks the collateral backing of MBS.\n",
            "\n",
            "The managers sometimes take notable interest-rate risk, too. Although the fund's duration typically stays within a half year of the Bloomberg US MBS Index's, they will use interest-rate swaps and futures contracts to lengthen or shorten duration up to about 1.5 years versus the index. They will also position the fund to benefit from changes they anticipate in the shape of the yield curve.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PORTFOLIO]\n",
            "The fund's valuation-sensitive approach can lead to big swings over a short period in its mortgage-backed securities exposure, consisting largely of agency MBS and some higher-rated nonagency MBS. Between September 2019 and June 2020, the MBS stake increased 31 percentage points to 88.0% of assets before dropping 37 percentage points to 50.8% by year-end 2021 and then increasing again by nearly 40 percentage points to 90.4% in March 2024. That MBS stake subsequently dropped 14 percentage points to 76.3% in March 2025. \n",
            "\n",
            "The fund\u2019s dramatic shifts in MBS exposure have largely tracked widening and narrowing yield premiums of MBS over Treasuries, driven in part by the Federal Reserve's market participation. When increasing that stake in 2020, for example, the managers invested heavily in the lower-coupon mortgages that the Fed's monthly purchase program then favored, while avoiding higher-coupon MBS that were exposed to prepayment risk amid plummeting interest rates. In the recent higher interest-rate environment, however, the managers have preferred FNMA and FHLMC mortgages with coupons of at least 4.5% as there is less incentive to refinance.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fund's interest-rate stance can also stand out. The biggest duration bet occurred in 2015's third quarter, when the managers thought short-term interest rates would not rise as quickly as market prices suggested. The fund's then 5.9-year duration was 1.6 years longer than that of the Bloomberg US MBS Index and was the highest out of roughly 30 agency-MBS-focused intermediate government category peers, outpacing the closest competitor by a year. In March 2025, the fund's 6.4-year duration was again the highest among those same agency-MBS-focused peers.\n",
            "\n",
            "[PERFORMANCE]\n",
            "Stellar.\n",
            "\n",
            "The team's proficiency in dialing up and down agency MBS exposure, while at times courting significant interest-rate risk, has led to a strong record for this strategy. Since the fund's November 2010 inception, the R6 shares' 1.92% annualized gain through April 23, 2025, beat the Bloomberg US MBS Index by 31 basis points and placed first out of 25 mortgage-focused intermediate government category peers with a track record that long. Meanwhile, the fund's Sharpe ratio, a volatility-adjusted measure, also outpaced all rivals.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fund's overall record notwithstanding, relative results in any given year can vary. On the one hand, the fund excelled from 2020 through 2022. Significantly increasing and then decreasing agency MBS exposure while shortening and lengthening duration worked in the fund\u2019s favor in 2020, for example, as did the team's preference for lower-coupon mortgages at the height of the fund's exposure that year. The fund's 7% gain in 2020 beat the index by 314 basis points and placed first among all mortgage-focused peers.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, fund struggled in 2019 and again from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, interest-rate positioning hurt the most. Anticipating that the inverted yield curve would steepen, the managers focused the portfolio's duration on the two- and five-year part of the Treasury yield curve while underweighting longer-dated issues. But yields at the short end of the yield curve moved higher than those at the longer end. As a result, the fund's 4% gain in 2023 lagged the index by 104 basis points and was the second-worst among mortgage-focused peers.\n",
